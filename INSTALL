HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THIS OSG TREE GEN

INSTALLATION:

osg-tree-gen has only been successfully tested on Ubuntu 12.04.

After having configured, built, and installed all of the above prerequisites,
you are now ready to build osg-tree-gen! Once in the osg-tree-gen directory, the
following commands will build the generator:

cd src
cmake CMakeLists.txt

RUNNING THE GAME:

To run the generator, type
./tree-gen

Click-drag your mouse to rotate the camera.
Scroll in and out to zoom in and out. Press the spacebar to return to normal zoom.
Press the Esc key to exit the generator.

If you would like to play around with tree variables, please feel free to modify
